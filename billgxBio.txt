My name is Bill Genereux. I have been a professor at K-State Salina for 18 years. I have been working with computers for over 30 years. The first computer I wrote code on was a TRS-80 Model III owned by my high school. I didn't really know what I was doing. Not too much has changed. I'm still learning.

I joined the Navy out of high school. They sent me to Advanced Electronics Training where I learned about the computer technology used to control US Navy weapons systems. I was in the first Persian Gulf War in 1991. After that, I returned to Kansas where I found work as a graphic designer in a screen printing shop. I worked there for a few years then I decided to attend college using the G.I. Bill. 

I attended Cloud County Community College, Kansas Wesleyan University, Fort Hays State University and yes, Kansas State University to earn degrees from Associate of Arts through Ph.D. This academic work was almost all related to computers and technology in some way or another.

I'm married for nearly 30 years. I have two grown children. And I really enjoy teaching the next generation of technology experts.
